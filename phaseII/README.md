# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

## Introduction

The goal of Dynamic Scheduler is to take the weight of scheduling off our users' backs. The last report left the team mainly focused on making the application a more convenient experience as well as adding features to better optimize the usability of it as well. Our main goal was to design a wireframe of our application that would satisfy each simulation of a users' scenario.

## Methods

* Cognitive Walkthrough
  * To replicate the method you must have users document their walkthrough of the app, and give feedback on any issues or problems they faced.
  * Received 3 people’s feedback (2 for Eric, 1 for Dave)

## Findings

* Cognitive Walkthrough
  * Eric
      * There was no way to log in or sign out in our wireframe.
      * There was no way to exit the profile page.
  * Dave
      * There was no way to sign in.
      * There was no way to get to the "add/view event" page.
        
Overall, users noted that either we were missing pages or clearly missing a button that would navigate them to the desired page. Aside from that, the rest of our wireframe design was easy to understand.

## Conclusions

Our UX team realized the Dynamic Scheduler application currently resembles a standard calendar application. Its most unique feature, the algorithm that automatically schedules tasks into free time based on a user’s priorities is hidden in the backend. While the interface should function as a straightforward calendar, it is important to highlight a powerful backend functionality that differentiates our application.

Our design recommendations offered a lot of insight. There were several things our entire UX team overlooked, but it helped us see things from a different perspective and make the changes we need for better usability. Overlooked features included: the need to give more attention to our navigation, to return to previous pages, and inclusion of buttons to navigate to the user's desired page. Basically, we need to add a better flow to our wireframe that the user will feel comfortable with.


## Caveats

* One limitation tied to the cognitive walkthrough was that our wireframe (at the time) was not ready for all scenarios. We decided that the wireframe could only accommodate Eric’s scenario. Fortunately, we also got feedback for Dave’s walkthrough, but that left Bob’s walkthrough without feedback. To add, because we didn’t have a complete wireframe, some of the feedback was summed up with “no way to progress further” which won’t help us in the long run.
* If we wanted to correct this issue, we would need to collect more cognitive walkthrough data based on our updated wireframe to get the most useful feedback.
* To understand the findings, it’s important to know that the cognitive walkthrough was a class assignment: meaning that we were limited with the amount of feedback we received. More importantly, we didn’t have a complete wireframe to appropriately perform a cognitive walkthrough on.
