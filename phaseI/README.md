# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

## Introduction

Dynamic Scheduler is a real-time adjustable schedule that allows users to add items with varying and unique priority, availability, and expected times of completions. Dynamic Scheduler helps individuals optimize their daily activities, making it easier to stay organized and focused on what matters most. With an intuitive interface and customizable features, this app aims to enhance productivity and reduce the stress that comes with traditional scheduling methods. Throughout this phase, we focused on identifying our competitors to study any strengths and weaknesses they may have. With this, we can create our own potential users and any scenarios that need to be taken account for during the development of our software.

## Methods

!!! Describe research methods you used to discover new insights, which explains the purpose of each. Provide enough detail that someone would be able to faithfully reproduce your research. !!!

## Findings

!!! For each research method, detail each of the findings point-by-point to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!!

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!
