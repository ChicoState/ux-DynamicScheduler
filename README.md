# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

**Executive Summary**

* Competitive analysis revealed that while most competitors offer similar task management features, few provide the flexibility of dynamic scheduling that adjusts in real-time based on task priorities. Our solution uniquely integrates real-time prioritization, offering a more responsive and intuitive experience for time management.
* Heuristic evaluation of a close competitor revealed gaps in task prioritization and real-time adjustments. 
* Users of this type of service expect seamless task management with the ability to prioritize and adjust schedules dynamically. Our solution meets this demand by offering a priority-based schedule, tailored to fit any unique personal lifestyle.
* Confirmations before actions that modify important data, such as schedule changes, are essential and will remain a tentative suggestion until the user provides approval.
* The Sketches and Diagrams implement essential features, including icons and minimal buttons, to enhance a user-friendly interface.

# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

**Executive Summary**
