# UX - Dynamic Scheduler

Dynamic Scheduler is a real-time adjustable schedule that allows users to add items with varying and unique priority, availability, and expected times of completion. Dynamic Scheduler helps individuals optimize their daily activities, making it easier to stay organized and focused on what matters most. With an intuitive interface and customizable features, this app aims to enhance productivity and reduce the stress that comes with traditional scheduling methods.

# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

**Executive Summary**

* Competitive analysis revealed that while most competitors offer similar task management features, few provide the flexibility of dynamic scheduling that adjusts in real-time based on task priorities. Our solution uniquely integrates real-time prioritization, offering a more responsive and intuitive experience for time management.
* Heuristic evaluation of a close competitor revealed gaps in task prioritization and real-time adjustments. 
* Users of this type of service expect seamless task management with the ability to prioritize and adjust schedules dynamically. Our solution meets this demand by offering a priority-based schedule, tailored to fit any unique personal lifestyle.
* Confirmations before actions that modify important data, such as schedule changes, are essential and will remain a tentative suggestion until the user provides approval.
* The Sketches and Diagrams implement essential features, including icons and minimal buttons, to enhance a user-friendly interface.

# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

**Executive Summary**

* Cognitive walkthroughs revealed flaws within our design where multiple pages had no way to navigate back to a previous page.
* This consequential feedback tells us that we must improve our application's navigation in order to improve the user experience and workflow.
* Informal feedback showed an interest in varying new features to be added.
* Software engineering students not only suggested more customization of tasks, but they also wanted connectivity to other applications (Google Calendar) and to other users.
* With these gathered findings, we will focus on adding seamless navigation to the layout and look into adding the user-suggested features to leave our users with a convenient and familiar experience on the Dynamic Scheduler app.

# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

**Executive Summary**

* After earning our CITI certificates and creating the proper forms, we conducted and recorded assessments of real users.
* Users provided mostly high ratings on ease of usage in completing tasks.
* Users also provided qualitative feedback related to adding items to the calendar: noting that "Add Event" should be on the main page rather than in the sub-menu.
* When asked about how they felt about the website prototype, users stated that it was overall easy to navigate, well-organized, and familiar to other calendar apps.
* With all of the feedback compilied, we can make that simple notable change and claim we were successful in making an effective app.
