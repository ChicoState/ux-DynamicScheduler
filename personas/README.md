- Also keep occasional meeting times as the highest priority
- Organize his personal weekend tasks so he gets the most free time

## Scenarios

#**Dave**

Being the boss, Dave is able to leave work whenever he wants to but always seems to forget which daughter has what activities and when. It’s so hard when his job is full of exciting events all day. Dave knows it’s his job to juggle it all, but it's hard to do it alone. Every morning, Dave asks each of his daughters what they have going on that day and he does his best to remember. One day at work, Dave’s diver calls in sick, so he has to be the one to go underwater and salvage the valuable items. He ends up forgetting about his daughter’s dance recital and since he also could not drive her, she did not end up going either. This led to an upsetting series of events that night where his 9 year old daughter wouldn’t come out of the bathroom because she was absolutely sobbing and crying because she had to miss the ballet recital she worked so hard on for months.

#**Eric**

Eric’s team has just entered the playoffs, the number of practices he has increased, but now he is having some conflicting schedules between his classes and practices, although Eric has made the decision to prioritize sports at this point in the year, he must now completely rework his schedule to display his changed priorities, which he finds extremely time consuming and energy draining as the only time he has to do this is at the end of his long day.

#**Bob**

In this particular week, Bob wants to have a day off. He decides to work through as many tasks as possible for Monday-Thursday. Since he isn’t used to deviating from his typical schedule, he forgets about a company meeting on Thursday and barely makes it. He ends up having to work half of his shift on Friday to finish up his few remaining tasks.
